# TDA Project
My TDA project

The initial objective with this project is to analyse a users portfolio, account poisitions, and give sugestions for options strategies and portfolio diversification.

Later objectives include:
* Automaticaly rolling sold options contracts at a credit when time and stock conditions are met (covered calls)
* Creating saved orders that can later be seen in the thinkorswim platform
* Using thinkorswim dynamic watchlists (from the scan tool) to identify and recommend trades.
* Trade automatically if a defined set of conditions is met perfectly (after much testing with only recomendations and trade simulations)

### Note
I am in the last semseter of College and have a full time job in IT at Intel, I only really have time to work on this during the weekend!

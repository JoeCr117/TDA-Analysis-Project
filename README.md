# TDA Project
My TDA project

The objective with this project is to analyse a users portfolio, account poisitions, give sugestions for options strategies and portfolio diversification.

Later objectives include:\
*Automaticaly rolling sold options contracts at a credit when time and stock conditions are met
*Creating saved orders that can later be seen in the thinkorswim platform
*Using thinkorswim dynamic watchlists (from the scan tool) to identify and recommend trades.
*Trade automatically if a defined set of conditions is met perfectly (after much testing with only recomendations and trade simulations)
